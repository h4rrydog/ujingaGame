==========

Open source physical card game. Ujinga is the ridiculous activity cards game where you act silly and make your friends do stupid things.

Thank you to HEFCE (http://www.hefce.ac.uk/) for funding HELIX (http://helixcentre.com), and to our awesome Kickstarter backers who made this project possible (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/h4rrydog/ujinga-survival-of-the-silliest-an-activity-card-g).

This repository (with downloadable PDFs and other files) will be populated after we fulfill our pledges to our backers and officially launch the game. Please stay tuned.

In the mean time, check out our holding page (http://ujinga.co) and add your email address to our newsletter. We'll let you know when we officially launch.
